# FizzBuzz

**TODO: Add description**

## The Problem
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `fizz_buzz` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:fizz_buzz, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/fizz_buzz](https://hexdocs.pm/fizz_buzz).
